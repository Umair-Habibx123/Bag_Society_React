Step 5: Deploy to Firebase Hosting (Optional)
If you want to deploy your React app to Firebase Hosting, follow these steps:

Install Firebase CLI:

If you haven't installed Firebase CLI yet, run:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g firebase-tools
Login to Firebase:

Log in to Firebase from the terminal:

bash
Copy code
firebase login
Initialize Firebase in Your React Project:

Initialize Firebase Hosting in your React project directory:

bash
Copy code
firebase init
When prompted, select Hosting.
Choose your Firebase project.
Select build as the public directory (since Create React App builds to the build folder).
Configure it as a single-page app (answer yes to the "Configure as a single-page app" question).
Don't overwrite index.html if prompted.
Build Your React App:

Build your app for production:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Deploy to Firebase Hosting:

Finally, deploy your app:

bash
Copy code
firebase deploy
Once the deployment is complete, Firebase will provide a URL where your app is hosted.
